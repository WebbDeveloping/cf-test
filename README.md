This repository is a basic fake weather app, and it has a bunch of failing tests. Your task is to get the project up and running, look through the list of failed tests, and do your best to fix the bugs. It is possible that the instructions below won't work for your computer without some trial and error, but try to work through it.

If you aren't able to get everything running or can't fix all the tests, thatâ€™s okay. Just do as much as you feel comfortable with, and try not to spend more time than you are alright with.



Step 1: Clone this repository!

Step 2: Get python 3.7 running on your development environment: https://www.python.org

Step 3: Install poetry: https://poetry.eustace.io/

Step 4: On the command line inside the project directory, run: poetry install

Step 5: Run the tests with: poetry run pytest

Step 6: Notice a bunch of error output. There should be 7 failures, 6 passing tests, and maybe some warnings.

Step 7: Fix the bugs!

Step 8: Commit the fixes to your local git repo

Step 9: Make a pull request, or zip the repo and send it to us!


The entire project is just a few files, so you are encouraged to browse through and get a feel for it. The project is a python flask application, so you can run it like this: poetry run python app.py
